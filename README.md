Hey there ðŸ‘‹ , 

I'am Aji. I'm here to learn, collaborate, and build. I am interested in data science specifically machine learning and data mining. 
I am a Computer Science graduate student graduating in May 2022. Most of my repositories are school projects. I collaborated in 
group projects revolving around sentiment analyisis, prediction models, dimensionality reduction, neural netowrks, etc.. 

My most recent collaborative project aims to recreate a prediction model for ICU patients using ML algorithms such as RNNs, SAPS-II, 
Average pooling, self-Attention. The project attempts to reproduce the paper "Monitoring ICU Mortality Risk with A Long Short-Term Memory 
Recurrent Neural Network". This a final project for my computer science graduate program.
